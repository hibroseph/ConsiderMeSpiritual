# ConsiderMeSpiritual


## Welcome
I am a college student just trying to get some expierence with app developement to diversify my code portfolio. 
This app is geared towards the LDS (Latter Day Saint) community. It generates quotes that someone could give a 
quick spiritual thought on. App is currently in development and I am actively looking for people to contribute to 
this project to enhance it.

## Things To Do
* Develop a tagging system for the quotes (Both backend and frontend)
* Create sharing method to display quote in a picture with a picture background or gradiant color
* Create a custom view
* Animate transitions
* Make code more robust and modular
* What else can you think of?
