# ConsiderMeSpiritual


## Welcome
I am a college student just trying to get some expierence with app developement to diversify my code portfolio. This app is geared towards the LDS (Latter Day Saint) community. It generates quotes that someone could give a quick spiritual thought on. App is currently in development and I am actively looking for people to contribute to this project to enhance it.
